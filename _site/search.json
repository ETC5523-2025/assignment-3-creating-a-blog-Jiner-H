    "text": "What the Data Showed\nThis post summarizes results from the modelling study by Zachreson et al.¬†(2022), which tested quarantine performance under varying vaccine efficacy and viral transmissibility.\n\n1 Quarantine Breach Risk\nThe model simulated a 100-traveler facility and measured how often infected cases could leak into the community. When the basic reproduction number (R‚ÇÄ) = 6, vaccines needed to block at least 60 % of transmission to maintain pre-Delta safety. When R‚ÇÄ = 8, about 70 % was required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Breach risk falls as vaccine efficacy increases.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure¬†1, risk decreases as vaccine efficacy improves.\n\n\n2 Outbreak Probability\nWhen community coverage exceeded 80 % and vaccines were ‚â• 90 % effective, outbreaks were delayed by over 100 days. At ‚â§ 60 % efficacy, outbreaks re-emerged within weeks.\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Delay before outbreak by efficacy and R‚ÇÄ\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine efficacy\nR‚ÇÄ\nDelay before outbreak (days)\n\n\n\n\n60 %\n6\n15\n\n\n70 %\n8\n45\n\n\n90 %\n8\n100+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table¬†1, higher efficacy delays outbreaks."

    "section": "So, What Does It Mean?",
    "text": "So, What Does It Mean?\nThe study makes one thing clear: quarantine alone cannot stop highly transmissible variants.\nIt buys time but protection comes only from widespread vaccination and strong infection-control practice. For policymakers, this means focusing resources on mass vaccination, rapid testing, and staff protection, rather than relying solely on quarantine."
