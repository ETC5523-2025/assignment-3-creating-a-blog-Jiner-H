## The Challenge
When Australia first faced the Delta variant of COVID-19, strict border quarantine systems were our shield. Travellers spent two weeks in isolation while staff worked under tight infection-control rules. But Delta was different—more infectious, harder to contain, and faster to spread.  
Could our quarantine hotels still hold the line, or would vaccination become the only real defence?

## What the Data Showed
This post summarises results from the modelling study by Zachreson et al. (2022), which tested quarantine performance under varying vaccine efficacy and viral transmissibility.

### 1 Quarantine Breach Risk
The model simulated a 100-traveller facility and measured how often infected cases could leak into the community.
When the basic reproduction number (R₀) = 6, vaccines needed to block at least 60 % of transmission to maintain pre-Delta safety.
When R₀ = 8, about 70 % was required.

As shown in @fig-breach, risk decreases as vaccine efficacy improves.

### 2 Outbreak Probability
When community coverage exceeded 80 % and vaccines were ≥ 90 % effective, outbreaks were delayed by over 100 days.
At ≤ 60 % efficacy, outbreaks re-emerged within weeks.

Table: Delay before outbreak by efficacy and R₀ {#tbl-delay}  

| Vaccine efficacy |  R₀ | Delay before outbreak (days) |
| :--------------- | :-: | ---------------------------: |
| 60 %             |  6  |                           15 |
| 70 %             |  8  |                           45 |
| 90 %             |  8  |                         100+ |
  
As shown in @tbl-delay, higher efficacy delays outbreaks.

## So, What Does It Mean?
The study makes one thing clear: quarantine alone cannot stop highly transmissible variants.  
It buys time—but lasting protection comes only from widespread vaccination and strong infection-control practice.
For policymakers, this means focusing resources on mass vaccination, rapid testing, and staff protection, rather than relying solely on quarantine hotels.
